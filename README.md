> a portfolio of all the work I'm not too embarrassed to put on the internet

## How did you build this?

Well, friend, I'm glad you asked! My website lives on a [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet as a [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) server. I used this [wonderful tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-fastcgi-caching-with-nginx-on-your-vps) to create a virtual front-facing server that caches all static files to make it lickety split fast. 

In terms of my developer workflow, I [Yeoman'ed](http://yeoman.io/) up a project using [this generator](https://github.com/sondr3/generator-jekyllized) that utilizes [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a static website builder) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (an automation tool).


## OK, but how did you design it?

After scouring the internet looking inspiration, it became obvious to me that my target audience (potential employers) wanted to get right into the meat of my portfolio: the projects. I peeled away all the excess that was being added and made these front and center with only a short description of my story and contact information to balance it out.


## Do you have a favorite part?

Wow, you're asking some great questions! I think my favorite part would have to be the gifs that pop up when you hover (or click on mobile) the links under my name.

## Any future plans?

Right now I'm making a [iot](https://www.google.com/search?q=internet+of+things) candy dispenser that has no way of dispensing in person (ie no physical interface). The only way to dispense candy is by pressing a button on my website. My reasoning? It's a blend of my favorite things: Internet of Things, web design, candy, and positive social interactions.
