## Problem
The best way to learn a new language is to go to a country where that language is spoken. 
Immerse yourself in the environment. Spend time with native speakers.
But not every learner has a chance to do this.
This is especially detrimental to intermediate learners who are just about to become fluent.
To address this problem our team developed the question: 
**How can we help language learners with limited access to native speakers improve their speaking?**

## Research

### Interviews
Our team sat down with both language instructors and students in order to surface pain points they experienced.
Instructors showed us the typical journey one travels to learn a new language. They also highlighted typical pitfalls their students encounter along the way. Language learners echoed these struggles and their personal techniques they used to make progress. One interesting trend we heard from successful language learners was how they would augment fun activities in order to practice their target language.

### Observation
In order to better empathize with beginners and interact with more experienced speakers, our team joined a Spanish language meetup at _Villa Escondida_, a Mexican restaurant in Bell Town.
We talked to Spanish speakers (both native and non-native) about how they practice Spanish while living in Seattle.

#### Research Insights
* One of the biggest pain points for learners is practicing speaking
* The best way to practice speaking is with a native speaker, but they are not always available
* Successful language learners pair fun activities with language learning

## Ideation

### Prompts
Fueled by our new insights, our team quickly developed dozens of ideas through various ideation techniques. We created the following prompts as a way to ensure our solution would be informed by our research findings:

- What fun activities would compliment speaking a language?
- How can we provide a comfortable environment for learners to practice speaking?
- How can we assure learners they are making progress in order to keep them engaged and coming back?

#### Final Concept
Through several rounds of ideation as well as validating the idea with language learners, our team moved forward to design and prototype Dover (the shortening of dub-over). Dover gives language learners with limited access to native speakers an opportunity to practice speaking and listening through an enriched video watching experience.

Here's how it works. As learners listen and echo a shows' dialogue, they correct their pronunciation to match their speech with what they are hearing.

## Prototype
Our functioning prototype was built on Premiere Pro, a video editing application, because of its ability to import closed captions, create dynamic markers in the video timeline, and ability to record audio directly onto the video. We customized the keyboard shortcuts within Premiere Pro to be able to quickly navigate the video to the next and previous lines of dialogue based on the closed captions.

We then customized a mobile application called [Unified Remote](https://www.unifiedremote.com/){:target="_blank"}
that can control the video in Premiere Pro. This gave us a lot of flexibility. For example, when we were testing our prototype with potential users, we were able to redesign button layout and behavior on the fly with relative ease to test users feedback.

#### Testing and Refinements

We tested our prototype in depth with four learners. Participants were asked to complete various tasks out-loud to test usability. We also asked participants to express how they felt using Dover. Here are some of our takeaways:

- Participants at first felt nervous recording and listening to their own voice. Once they had actually listened, however, they found the process fun and engaging. 
-  Participants' attention was split between the app and the video. This resulted in frustrating moments of pressing the incorrect button or missing a part of the show.
-  Participants were in disagreement (even with themselves) whether a swipe left or right should move the video forward or backward.

All of these takeaways were addressed in our final design. Some of the suggestions were even implemented during the prototyping session because of the flexibility of our system.
