## Problem
Recent years have seen the increasing popularity of fitness tracking applications, among which [Strava](http://strava.com/){:target="_blank"} plays a leading role in facilitating online communities by individual connections and activity-based clubs. Strava users have the ability to search for clubs (groups) of athletes based on similiar interest and location. Where Strava's current search fails, however, is in helping users understand a club's riding habbits. For example, if I am searching for cycling clubs here in Seattle Strava provides over 90 clubs. The majority of these clubs only list 'Seattle' as their location. This is a problem because Seattle is a big, dense city. Finding a group of cyclists who ride around Greeen Lake is much different than a group that pedal through West Seattle for instance (to see this current search in action [click here](https://www.strava.com/clubs/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&text=&location=Seattle&%5Bcountry%5D=United+States&%5Bstate%5D=Washington&%5Bcity%5D=Seattle&%5Blat_lng%5D=47.6062095%2C-122.3320708&sport_type=cycling&club_type=all){:target="_blank"}).
