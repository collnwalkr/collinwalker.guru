I tried logging into [Medium](https://medium.com/){:target="_blank"} the other day from my new device.
This was the screen I was met with:
![description]({{ site.images }}posts/{{page.thumbnail}}/{{page.thumbnail}}-0.jpg){: .small data-action="zoom"}
![description]({{ site.images }}posts/{{page.thumbnail}}/{{page.thumbnail}}-1.jpg){: .small .right data-action="zoom"}
