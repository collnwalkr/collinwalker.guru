## Problem
The best way to learn a new language is to go to a country where that language is spoken. 
Immerse yourself in the environment. Spend time with native speakers.
But not every learner has a chance to do this.
This is especially detrimental to intermediate learners who are just about to become fluent.
So our team developed the question: 
**How can we help language learners with limited access to native speakers improve their speaking?**

## Objective
Our team set out to research, design, and prototype a language learning solution that can help learners practice their speaking.
Our solution: Dover (dub-over).
Dover gives language learners with inadequate access to native speakers an opportunity to practice speaking and listening through an enriched video watching experience. 
As learners listen to dialogue and echo it, they correct their pronunciation to match their speech with what they are hearing.

## Research
### Interviews
In order to learn about the process of language learning and current pain points, we sat down with both language instructors and learners alike.
Instructors showed us the typical journey one travels to learn a new language. They also surfaced typical
pitfalls their students encounter along the way. Language learners echoed these struggles and their personal techniques they used
to make progress.


### Observation
In order to better empathize with learners and interact with more learners, our team joined a Spanish language meetup.

## Ideation

### Prompts
How do we spark an activity where language learning is a secondary activity?

How can we provide learners an comfortable environment to practice speak?

How can we provide a sense of achievement for learners?
