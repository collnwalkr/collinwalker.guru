## Problem
The best way to learn a new language is to go to a country where that language is spoken. 
Immerse yourself in the environment. Spend time with native speakers.
But not every learner has a chance to do this.
This is especially detrimental to intermediate learners who are just about to become fluent.
So our team developed the question: 
**How can we help language learners with limited access to native speakers improve their speaking?**

## Research

### Interviews
Our team sat down with both language instructors and learners alike in order to surface any pain points learners experience while learning a new language.
Instructors showed us the typical journey one travels to learn a new language. They also surfaced typical pitfalls their students encounter along the way. Language learners echoed these struggles and their personal techniques they used to make progress. One interesting trend we heard from successful language learners was how they would augment fun activities in order to practice their target language.

### Observation
In order to better empathize with beginning learners and interact with more experienced speakers our team joined a Spanish language meetup at _Villa Escondida_, a Mexican restaurant in Bell Town.
The night was filled with talking to Spanish speakers (both native and non-native) about how they practice Spanish living in Seattle.

#### Research Insights
* One of the biggest pain points for language learning is practicing speaking
* The best way to practice speaking is with a native speaker but they are not always available
* Successful language learners couple fun activities with language learning as a secondary activity

## Ideation

### Prompts
Fueled by our new insights, our team quickly developed dozens of ideas through various ideation techniques. We created the following prompts as a way to ensure our solution would be informed by our research findings:

- How do we spark an activity where language learning is a secondary activity?
- How can we provide a comfortable environment for learners to practice speaking?
- How can we assure learners they are making progress in order to keep them engaged and coming back for more practice?

#### Final Concept
Through several rounds of ideation as well as validating the idea with language learners, our team moved forward to design and prototype Dover (dub-over). Dover gives language learners with inadequate access to native speakers an opportunity to practice speaking and listening through an enriched video watching experience. As learners listen to dialogue and echo it, they correct their pronunciation to match their speech with what they are hearing.
